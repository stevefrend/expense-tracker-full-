My first real JS project. Trying to make an expense tracker for myself that I ultimately want to have as an app on my phone. It should have a simple main page where you can either enter a category, or an expense. Everything should be stored in an object. On a different page, I want to be able to see my total spent in each category for different time periods, and also the averages.

The main goal of this project is for learning, not to create a final product. I'll probably re-build this product once I get to a level where I can built it in React etc.
